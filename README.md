###  Feeling tired?
Forget the extra cup of coffee and listen to this re-energizing playlist instead.

Built using the Soundcloud API, this simple standalone player lets you listen to multiple songs that have been uploaded to Soundcloud by users...without using the pre-made Soundcloud widget! The player displays the track title, track artwork, user information and more.
